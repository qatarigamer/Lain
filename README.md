# Lain

This is the front-end designed for osu!verge, replacing Hayano. It is planned to be extremely fast and easily manageable. 
It is designed to work with both our new bancho and pep.py (for fallback purposes). It is also designed to handle
beatmaps being directly downloaded from our mirror. 

If you want to contribute, ask on our Discord for guidance or help! https://discord.gg/MePPfS7

**Why replace Hayano?**

Hayano is made to be a one-size-fits-all. With some of the ideas floating around internally, we decided to rewrite the 
codebase to better suit us and certain other servers, with a modern design refresh. (Hayano looks too plain for me)
